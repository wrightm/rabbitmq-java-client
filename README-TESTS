Overview
========

There are multiple test suites in the RabbitMQ Java client library;
the source for all of the suites can be found in the test/src
directory.

The suites are:

  Client tests
  Functional tests
  Server tests
  SSL tests

The Server test suite cannot be launched from the public umbrella
( http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella ). Attempting to launch
this suite by executing the "test-server" ant target will fail, because
test necessary prerequisites are not present in the public umbrella.

All other tests require a conforming server listening on localhost:5672
(the default settings). SSL tests require a broker listening on the default
SSL port. For details on running specific tests, see below.


Running a Specific Test Suite
=============================

To run a specific test suite you should execute one of the following in the
top-level directory of the source tree:

  ant test-client
  ant test-functional
  ant test-ssl


For example, to run the client tests:

----------------- Example shell session -------------------------------------
rabbitmq-java-client$ ant test-client
Buildfile: build.xml

test-prepare:

test-build:

amqp-generate-check:

amqp-generate:

build:

test-build-param:

test-client:
    [junit] Running com.rabbitmq.client.test.ClientTests
    [junit] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 2.388 sec

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any tests are broken details can be found by viewing this file:
	build/TEST-com.rabbitmq.client.test.ClientTests.txt


SSL Test Setup
--------------

To run the SSL tests, the RabbitMQ server and Java client should be configured
as per the SSL instructions on the RabbitMQ website. The SSL_CERTS_DIR
environment variable must point to a certificate folder with the following
minimal structure:

   $SSL_CERTS_DIR
   |-- client
   |   |-- keycert.p12
   |   |-- cert.pem
   |   \-- key.pem
   |-- server
   |   |-- cert.pem
   |   \-- key.pem
   \-- testca
       \-- cacert.pem

The PASSWORD environment variable must be set to the password of the keycert.p12
PKCS12 keystore. The broker must be configured to validate client certificates.
This will become minimal broker configuration file if $SSL_CERTS_DIR is replaced
with the certificate folder:

%%%%% begin sample test broker configuration
[{rabbit, [{ssl_listeners, [5671]},
           {ssl_options,   [{cacertfile,"$SSL_CERTS_DIR/testca/cacert.pem"},
                            {certfile,"$SSL_CERTS_DIR/server/cert.pem"},
                            {keyfile,"$SSL_CERTS_DIR/server/key.pem"},
                            {verify,verify_peer},
                            {fail_if_no_peer_cert, false}]}]}].
%%%%% end sample test broker configuration
