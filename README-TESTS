There are multiple test suites in the RabbitMQ Java client library; the source
for all of the suites can be found in the test/src directory.

The suites are:

  Client tests
  Funtional tests

To run any of these test suites you need to first satisfy the following
preconditions:

  1. Ensure that you are running a RabbitMQ server locally on the standard 
port.
  2. Ensure that you have successfully built the javas client using ANT.

All the test suites can be run with the command ant test-suite. To run 
specific test suites see the instructions below.


RUNNING CLIENT TESTS

To run these tests, from the command line in the project directory execute
the command ant test-client. For example:

----------------- Example shell session -------------------------------------
rabbitmq-java-client$ ant test-client
Buildfile: build.xml

test-prepare:

test-build:

amqp-generate-check:

amqp-generate:

build:

test-build-param:

test-client:
    [junit] Running com.rabbitmq.client.test.ClientTests
    [junit] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 2.388 sec

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any tests are broken details can be found by viewing this file:

RUNNING FUNCTIONAL TESTS

To run these tests, from the command line in the project directory execute
the command ant test-functional.

----------------- Example shell session -------------------------------------
rabbitmq-java-client$ ant test-functional
Buildfile: build.xml

test-prepare:

test-build:

amqp-generate-check:

amqp-generate:

build:

test-build-param:

test-functional:
    [junit] Running com.rabbitmq.client.test.functional.FunctionalTests
    [junit] Tests run: 69, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 10.621 sec

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 11 seconds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
