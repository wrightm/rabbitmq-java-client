Overview
========

There are multiple test suites in the RabbitMQ Java client library;
the source for all of the suites can be found in the test/src
directory.

The suites are:

  Client tests
  Functional tests
  Server tests
  SSL tests

All the tests require a conforming server listening on localhost:5672
(the default settings).  For details on running specific tests, see
below.

All the test suites can be run with the command ant test-suite. To run
specific test suites see the instructions below.


Running a Specific Test Suite
=============================

To run a specific test suite, but not the others, you should execute
one of the following in the top-level directory of the source tree:

  ant test-client
  ant test-functional
  ant test-server
  ant test-ssl

Note that to run the SSL tests, the RabbitMQ server should be
configured to use SSL as per the SSL with RabbitMQ guide. The
SSL_CERTS_DIR environment variable must point to a certificate
folder containing a /client/ subfolder with a client certificate
and the PASSWORD variable must point to the key password. The
broker must be configured to validate client certificates.

The server and functional tests are meant to test a RabbitMQ broker.
Broadly, they require a running RabbitMQ broker on the default
host/port, the source code for rabbitmq-server in ../rabbitmq-server,
and a test directory ../rabbitmq-test.  These folders must each
contain an appropriate Makefile.  The test source can be scanned for
instances of "Host.executeCommand" to find required Makefile targets.

Clustering tests require brokers on ports 5672 and 5673.  Tests that
require a clustered environment will be skipped if the second broker
is absent.

For example, to run the client tests:

----------------- Example shell session -------------------------------------
rabbitmq-java-client$ ant test-client
Buildfile: build.xml

test-prepare:

test-build:

amqp-generate-check:

amqp-generate:

build:

test-build-param:

test-client:
    [junit] Running com.rabbitmq.client.test.ClientTests
    [junit] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 2.388 sec

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
