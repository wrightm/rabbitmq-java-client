Overview
========

A number of examples are packaged with the source distribution and
with the tests jar in the binary distribution. These examples vary in
complexity from simple clients and servers through to complex test
harnesses that are used for testing the RabbitMQ server.

The source code for the examples can be found in the
test/src/com/rabbitmq/examples directory of the source distribution.


Running the Examples
====================

The script runjava.sh or runjava.bat can be found in the top level
directory of the binary distribution or in the scripts directory of
the source distribution.

This script can be used to run the examples.  For instance, if you are
using the binary distribution and if you have a RabbitMQ broker
running and you open two shell or console windows you can test basic
connectivity like this:

shell-1$ ./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.SimpleConsumer

shell-2$ ./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.SimpleProducer

shell-1$ ./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.SimpleConsumer
Message: the time is Fri Feb 26 08:28:58 GMT 2010

Running the examples from the source distribution requries two more
preliminary steps:

shell-1$ ant dist

shell-1$ cd build/dist/

Now, the examples can be run exactly as detailed above.

The more complex examples will require additional command line
arguments and it is best to examine the source of the examples to
determine what arguments are available.

All examples live in the com.rabbitmq.examples package, so just add
that package name to the examples described below to produce the full
classname that is required as the first argument to the runjava
script.


Simple Examples
===============

SimpleProducer - Sends a message to an exchange.
SimpleConsumer - Reads a message from a queue.
SimpleTopicProducer - Sends a message to a topic exchange.
SimpleTopicConsumer - Reads a message from a topic queue.
SendString - Send a string to an exchange.
FileProducer - Sends a file to an exchange.
FileConsumer - Reads a file from a queue.
HelloClient - Performs a simple RPC call over AMQP.
HelloServer - Acts as an RPC server over AMQP.
HelloJsonClient - Performs a simple JSON-RPC call over AMQP.
HelloJsonServer - Acts as a JSON-RPC server over AMQP.
LogTail - Tails the server logs.
SendString - Sends a user-supplied message over AMQP.


More Complex Examples
=====================

Most of these examples are used in testing and tuning the RabbitMQ
server.

BufferPerformanceMetrics - Tests buffer sizing.
ChannelCreationPerformance - Test different Channel creation strategies.
ConsumerMain - Measures performance of Consumers.
ManyConnections - Tests many connections.
MulticastMain - Measures performance of multiple consumers and producers.
ProducerMain - Measures performance of Producers.
SpammyTopicProducer - Sends lots of different topic messages over AMQP.
StressPersister - Stress test for persister.
TestMain - RabbitMQ server regression tests.
TracerConcurrencyTest - Tests correct concurrency behaviour of RabbitMQ tracer.
