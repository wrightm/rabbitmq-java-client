A number of examples are packaged with the source distribution and with the 
tests jar in the binary distribution. These examples vary in complexity from 
simple clients and servers through to complex test harnesses that are used for 
testing the RabbitMQ server.

The source code for the examples can be found in the test/src/com/rabbitmq/examples directory of the source distribution.
